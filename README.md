# 📷 Image Filters Project – Structured Programming (Assignment 3)

## 📌 Overview

This project is part of the FCAI Structured Programming (CS112) Assignment 3 – 2024.
It provides a set of image processing filters and transformations implemented in C++.
The program allows users to load an image, apply different filters, and save the modified image with a new filename.
